## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Context-Based State Management
```
AuthProvider (User authentication & sessions)
└── WishlistProvider (Wishlist state & persistence)
    └── CartProvider (Shopping cart functionality)
        └── Application Components
```

### Secure Route Protection
- `AuthGuard` component protects `/account/*` routes
- Automatic redirects for unauthenticated users
- Loading states during authentication checks

### Clean URL Structure
- Fixed dynamic route conflicts (`[category]` vs `[id]`)
- Organized routes: `/products/category/[name]` for categories
- API routes properly await params for Next.js 15 compatibility
